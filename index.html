			Brain-Computer Systems in Humans
			</summary>					
			<p class="left">
			In a recent tweet, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO teased that a brain-computer system that links human brains 
			to a computer interface — a "neural lace" — may be announced early this year, reported TechCrunch. 
			Musk first mentioned the neural lace concept (the addition of a digital layer of intelligence to the human brain) 
			at Recode’s Code Conference last year. The brain-computer system would create a"symbiosis with machines," 
			Musk said, according to TechCrunch. [Super-Intelligent Machines: 7 Robotic Futures]

			"We’re already a cyborg — I mean, you have a digital or partial version of yourself in the form of your emails 
			and your social media and all the things that you do, and you have basically superpowers with your computer 
			and your phone and the applications that are there," Musk said at the conference.

			By building this connection to computers, Musk said that humans would be able to keep pace with advances in 
			artificial intelligence. As complex computers develop virtual intelligences, Musk warned that humans could be 
			rendered vastly inferior.

			In comparison to computers, Musk said humans' fundamental limitation is input/output. The human output level 
			is incredibly slow — such as using two thumbs to type on a phone — according to Musk, in comparison to the 
			speed at which humans take in information.

			"Effectively merging in a symbiotic way with digital intelligence revolves around eliminating the I/O constraint, 
			which would be some sort of direct cortical interface," Musk said.

			Drone That Takes Pictures/Videos of You From Air
			</summary>					
			<p class="left">
			Instead of extending your arm or using a selfie stick to snap shots of you and your crew, you could use a new
			pocket-size drone â€” dubbed the "AirSelfie" â€” to help you remotely capture aerial photos and videos.

			The AirSelfie is the brainchild of Italian entrepreneur Edoardo Stroppiana, who came up with the idea in 
			2014. "AirSelfie is specifically designed and produced for people who used to think drone cameras are 
			extremely complicated to use â€” too expensive and bulky," Stroppiana said.

			The AirSelfie is equipped with a 5-megapixel camera that can shoot full high-definition (HD) 1080p video, 
			as well as a 4GB microSD card. Using the AirSelfie, people, groups and companies can take pictures of
			themselves, their backgrounds and their projects from distances, heights and angles that they never could 
			using their arms or a stick, Stroppiana said. [5 Technologies for the Selfie-Obsessed]

			The drone's four rotors help it fly up to 65 feet (20 meters) in the air. The flying camera measures only about 
			3.72 by 2.65 by 0.42 inches (9.45 by 6.73 by 1.07 centimeters) â€” "smaller than a smartphone," Stroppiana said 
			â€” and weighs 1.83 ounces (52 grams).

			The drone uses sonar to measure its altitude and keeps itself stable with the help of a tiny extra camera to 
			monitor its surroundings for signs of jitter. It is also equipped with gyroscopes, barometers and geomagnetic 
			sensors that help it navigate as it flies, said AirSelfie Holdings Ltd. in London, the company that Stroppiana 
			co-founded in 2016 to manufacture the drone.

			The AirSelfie is controlled via a free iOS or Android app. The app can make the drone take off; adjust its 
			height and direction; let it hover autonomously; and help users take an HD aerial shot or video with just a 
			push of a button. Users can also activate a 10-second timer, giving people enough time to hide their phones 
			so they don't appear in the picture or video. The drone can take up to eight consecutive shots, the company 
			said.

			The AirSelfie uses Wi-Fi to send photos and videos wirelessly to smartphones. The app also allows users to 
			post photos and videos taken with the drone immediately on social media.

			After snapping photos, the drone can return to its departure point automatically with the touch of a button. 
			Users can also guide the AirSelfie back manually, and its manufacturers said it is safe for the drone to land 
			on a person's open hand, or even for people to grab the drone while it is still hovering in midair.

			A rechargeable lithium polymer battery gives the AirSelfie a flight time of 3 minutes, according to the 
			company. An accessory known as the Power Bank slips over the AirSelfie like a smartphone case, and 
			can recharge the drone in 30 minutes. The Power Bank can hold 20 such charges before it needs to be 
			recharged, the company said. Users can also recharge the AirSelfie directly with a micro-USB cable.

			The company said it developed a fully functioning prototype in August. On Nov. 17, the company launched 
			a Kickstarter campaign to make the AirSelfie available via preorder, and it met its $47,714 goal in less than
			three days. The campaign, which is scheduled to end Dec. 24, has raised more than $500,000 from more 
			than 2,300 backers. In addition, the company has received $3 million from private angel investors in the 
			United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and China, Stroppiana said.

			The first preordered drones are scheduled for delivery in March. The drone is expected to hit the market 
			in 2017 for a retail price of $300.

			<p class="left">
			It's niche, but the Sprout G2, with its integrated 3D and 2D scanners, is perfect for product designers, CGI 
			creators and other folks who can benefit from incorporating 3D models into their workflow. It's also got a 
			stylus-enabled touch mat that acts as a second screen.

			<p class="left">
			This underwater drone can submerge up to 98 feet (30 meters) and records 4K video streamed to your phone, which 
			you use to navigate. Not impressed? OK, with its add-on Fishfinder sonar it can detect fish up to 131 feet 
			(40 meters) away and and lures them with a blue light. Still not wowed? PowerVision will be offering VR goggles
			that allow you to robot around by tilting your head.
